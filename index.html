	    <h2>Team Profile</h2>
	    <h3>Team Name</h3>
	    <p>Simple Tech - Another way of saying that we make things nice and easy. </p>
	    <h3>Personal information</h3>
	    <h4>Andrew</h4>
	    <p>Hi my name is Andrew Chen, my student number is S3599919 and I am a manager at  Simple Tech. I was born and raised in Australia, specifically in Carlton. My nationality is Chinese and I can speak both Cantonese and Mandarin. I really love learning about computers and specifically on how to assemble and troubleshoot, my hobbies include gaming on the PC and playing basketball with my friends. My interests in I.T include learning how to build computers and learning more in depth about troubleshooting, I do not have much I.T experience outside of home, as I am more of a self-taught learner, hence majority of the things I learn are from the Internet or from PC Magazines. 

</p>
	    <h4>Navjot</h4>
	    <p>Hi my name is Navjot Singh, my student number is S3730255 and I am also a manager at Simple Tech. I was born in and raised in India and my nationality is Indian, but i can also speak Punjabi, Hindi and English. My interests in I.T are related to the designing and developing of effective software, hence I hope to become a software engineer or a website developer in the near future. </p>
	      <h4>Krista</h4>
	    <p>Hi my name is Bingxin Ni, but people call me Krista, my student number is S3632682. Like Andrew and Navjot, I am also a manager at Simple Tech. I was born and raised in Nanjing, Jiangsu Province, China. I speak Mandarin majority of the times but I can also speak English.  My interests include playing games because I have been playing it ever since I was very young, it allows me to have a better understanding of how games work and hopefully with the technology that I learn I am able to create my own game in the future.I have learned some about 3D modeling and I have learned some simple I.T. knowledge, but almost no  experience.</p>
	<h3>Team Profile</h3>
	     <h4>Andrew</h4>
	    <p>Firstly, starting off with the Myer-Briggs Test, the results that were acquired from that test stated that I had what they call a "Consul" Personality which meant that I was known for my reliability and kindness, and are able to create and maintain a secure and stable environment for myself and my loved ones. Secondly, the learning style test has unrevealed that I am a Visual Learner. The IPIP Big Five Factor results have shown that I was an Extrovert, which meant that I was outgoing and social. I was close to 100% Emotional Stability meaning that I am functioning almost perfectly without any interruptions to my work ability due to my mental health state. I am agreeable towards many things as I am friendly and very optimistic, I am also conscientious with whatever I do and diligent, and last but not least I am open to new experiences.
</p>
	     <h4>Navjot</h4>
	    <p>After the analyse these tests I got lot of Information about my behaviour, thinking and knowledge about the ability of learning skills .Those are helpful in my information technology study . Even it's also provide me basic knowledge about me and also give a sign to interact with people and collect the knowledge about study .Moreover, owing to these results team can easily influence to work with cooperate nature and trying to do better with their energy as same me to use there energy because i have enough capacity to use our energy for my betterment as well as for team profit. When the team forming that time by showing the capacity and ability we must make them good to o better for each other and informed them to use our problem solving skills as well as use study skills to overcome with troubles .
</p>
	     <h4>Krista</h4>
	    <p>These test results mean that I am a person with imagination and creativity. I am an idealist. I don't follow the rules that I think are unreasonable. I am an introverted and calm person. I like to listen instead of saying that my teammates will like me very much, but I don’t like teamwork myself.</p>

	       <h2>IT Work</h2>
			<p><h4>1. Please tell us about your IT work. What exactly do you do?</h4>
I am a Technical Support Officer – I administer the business and systems to ensure that employees are able to use the technological tools required to perform their daily work tasks.
<h4>2. Please tell us about the industry you work in.</h4>
I work in a globally recognized real estate firm.
<h4>3. What other kinds of work do you have to do?</h4>
I mainly deal with troubleshooting and resolving issues that users are experiencing. We also undergo projects that involve rolling out new technologies to enhance work productivity and improve business processes.

<h4>4. Who are all the different people you interact with in your work? Please tell us about them.</h4>
We deal with internal users only which are the people within our organization. Mainly filled with agents who can be demanding from time to time when they are under pressure from communicating with external clients, we also assist team assistants who are the backbone in supporting their team members.
<h4>5. Please tell us about your interactions with other IT professionals.</h4>
We work closely together as a team to share knowledge and discuss/escalate issues across the Australia and New Zealand region, via different platforms such as instant messaging, emails, audio and video calls.
<h4>6. What about your interactions with clients or investors?</h4>
We don’t really interact with other clients, apart from a team which we escalate higher issues to.
<h4>7. What aspects of your work do you spend most time on? Please tell us about these.</h4>
Mainly troubleshooting, each and every day is always a different and odd issue. 
<h4>8. Which aspects of your work do you find most challenging?</h4>
The most challenging thing about this work is embracing the different issues that spontaneously occur, as it requires quick analysis and thinking of the situation. Sometimes you may not come across issues before so you have to try the best that you can to troubleshoot, isolate the possible factors that could contribute to the problem and find the root cause of it.
<h4>9. Finally, can you share an example of the work you do that best captures the essence of the IT industry?</h4>
Personally I feel that what best captures the essence of IT is delivering a seamless experience. This means that fixing/resolving/setting ups things while the user is not around, or before they even get into the office so that they get to their desk as if everything is functioning perfectly fine, as if there was no issue. We strongly try to be proactive and prevent issues from happening, as opposed to being reactive to when an issue arises.

	       <h2>IT Technologies</h2>
		<h3>Cyber security</h3>
		<p>Cybersecurity is the protection of internet-connected systems, including hardware, software and data, from cyberattacks. In a computing context, security comprises cybersecurity and physical security -- both are used by enterprises to protect against unauthorized access to data centres and other computerized systems. Information security, which is designed to maintain the confidentiality, integrity and availability of data centres and computerised system. Information security ,which is designed to maintain the confidentiality ,integrity and availability of data , is a sunset of cyber security. </p>

<p>Ensuring cybersecurity requires the coordination of efforts throughout an information system, which includes:</p>
<p>· Application security</p>
<p>· Information security</p>
<p>· Network security</p>
<p>One of the most problematic elements of cybersecurity is the constantly evolving nature of security risks. The traditional approach has been to focus resources on crucial system components and protect against the biggest known threats, which meant leaving components undefended and not protecting systems against less dangerous risks. </p>

<p> As the cyber threat landscape continues to grow and emerging threats, such as the internet of things, require hardware and software skills, it is estimated that there are 1 million unfilled cybersecurity jobs worldwide. IT professionals and other computer specialists are needed in security jobs, such as: </p>

<p>· chief information security officer(CISO): this individual implements the security program across the organization and oversees the IT security department's operations; </p>

<p>· security engineer: this individual protects company assets from threats with a focus on quality control within the IT infrastructure; </p>

<p>· security architect: this individual is responsible for planning, analysing, designing, testing, maintaining and supporting an enterprise's critical infrastructure; and
<p>· security analyst: this individual has several responsibilities that include planning security measures and controls, protecting digital files, and conducting both internal and external security audits. </p>

<p>The cyber threat landscape is constantly evolving, with different strains of malware attacking network systems every day. Organisations are losing the cyber war and, as a result, cybersecurity needs to evolve to combat the growing problem created by cyber attacks. This may take the form of security systems integrated with AI or simply stricter regulations so organisations will take the threat more seriously. Over the next five years, cyber security will evolve. But in what ways? Will the balance of the cyber war change, or will hackers still reign supreme? Information Age asked ten cyber security experts for their views on how the cyber security landscape will evolve in the next five years. </p>

<p>1 Automation</p>

<p>Security vendor check points regional director for Northern Europe, Nick Lowe, suggests that the standard cyber security practice will see automated responses to cyber attacks. </p>

<p>Cyber security defences will use more intelligence, big data analysis and machine learning to automatically identify threats and work proactively to expose and correlate the full operation of new cyber attack campaigns, he says. For example, a new attack might start with a malicious link being sent in an email to an Office 365 cloud. </p>

<p>The security solution will identify this, block the attack and upload the ‘indicators of compromise’ of the attack – that is, how it works – to a cloud-based threat intelligence service, which correlates it with other attack types. </p>

‘<p>So new attacks using that malicious link or website – for example, sending it by WhatsApp or SMS – get blocked automatically, before the attack can take hold. These attacks might otherwise seem unrelated, but in fact they could belong to a single attack campaign that is targeting an organisation using multiple vectors. </p>

<p>2  Block chain</p>
<p>Ian Smith, CEO and founder of Gospel Technology, believes that blockchain will be essential in protecting data from malicious attacks. </p>
<p>One way to tackle this issue of cyber security is with the use of a distributed ledger system, better known as blockchain, which guarantees the integrity and identity of the content appended through decentralised validation. </p>

<p> ‘Once recorded, this data cannot be changed, ensuring provenance and history for the key trust indicators of the digital assets,’ says Smith. ‘For data regulation, these are bound to a cryptographic hash and can then absolutely guarantee the integrity of the data. </p>

<p>Impact of cyber attack on your business</p>
<p>A successful cyber attack can cause major damage to your business. It can affect your bottom line, as well as your business' standing and consumer trust. The impact of a security breach can be broadly divided into three categories: financial, reputational and legal. </p>

<p>Economic cost of cyber attack</p>
<p>Cyber attacks often result in substantial financial loss arising from:</p>
<p>· theft of corporate information</p>
<p>· theft of financial information (eg bank details or payment card details)</p>
<p>· theft of money</p>


<p>Reputational damage</p>
<p>Trust is an essential element of customer relationship. Cyber attacks can damage your business' reputation and erode the trust your customers have for you. This, in turn, could potentially lead to: </p>

<p>· loss of customers</p>
<p>· loss of sales</p>
 
<p>Legal consequences of cyber breach</p>
<p>Data protection and privacy laws require you manage the security of all personal data you hold - whether on your staff or your customers. If this data is accidentally or deliberately compromised, and you have failed to deploy appropriate security measures, you may face fines and regulatory sanctions. </p>

 
<p>The human touch</p>
<p>Other professions which are less vulnerable to automation are those that require a human touch — from personal fitness trainers to beauticians and healthcare workers.
Nursing has existed as a profession for more than 150 years but is in no danger of being taken over by machines, according to Professor Phillip Della, head of the School of Nursing, Midwifery and Para medicine at Curtin University. </p>

<p>"You can automate tasks, you can have robots and you can use computers for diagnostic testing, but the caring factor, the human touch, having a nurse involved in that patient journey can't be replaced by a robot," Professor Della said. </p>

<p>Security architect</p>

<p>The senior-level security architect position involves designing, building, and overseeing the implementation of network and computer security for a company. Security architects must plan, research, and design strong security architectures for all IT projects, perform security assessments, respond to incidents, develop requirements for LANs, WANs, VPNs, routers, firewalls, and other network devices, as well as design PKIs, among other tasks. </p>

<p>Affects</p>
<p>HACKED ACCOUNTS</p>
<p>One common way for identity thieves to gain control of consumers’ personal information is through digital crimes known as “phishing.” In this practice, fraudsters create an email that looks like it was issued from a legitimate company. They will ask for a recipient’s personal information – like an account number or a password – and then use that information to commit financial crimes, such as opening fraudulent charge cards in a consumer’s name and running up big bills on them. </p>

<p>UNSECURED HOME WIRELESS NETWORKS</p>
<p>Many of us have converted to home wireless Internet networks to connect our TVs, smartphones, laptops, computers and tablets. And why not? It’s very convenient. But with these home networks come risks. Without certain protections, cyber criminals in the area may be able to access the Internet through your network and possibly gain access to your computer and other devices. </p>

<p>SPAM</p>
<p>You already know that “spam” is the email equivalent of junk mail. But it can do more than clutter up your inbox. Some of these email missives can contain a link or an attachment prompting you to download a computer virus. They can also be used to defraud those close to you. For instance, someone who has hacked into your email account can send a message asking every one of your contacts to wire money because you are in distress – and possibly rope in a few people who aren’t familiar with this common fraud</p>

<p>The number of connected devices has exponentially grown in the last year and there is a constant need to be connected. In fact, people are willing to engage in risky online behaviour in order to simply access Wi-Fi. </p>

<p>People are also known to share their passwords with friends, access financial information via unsecured Wi-Fi connections and click on suspicious links thereby increasing the vulnerability of their connected devices. Eighty percent of the consumers who took a compromising action in response to a potential phishing incident experienced negative consequences, including identify theft, money stolen from bank accounts, credit cards opened in their name and unauthorized apps installed on their device.
</p>
			<h3>Autonomous vehicles</h3>
		<p>Starting decades ago, people began to look at the automatic driving technique, car in many science fiction movies and game are also equipped with an automatic driving skills, and autopilot technology became one of the important research in recent years. In recent years, this technology has finally made substantial progress and will soon be ready for use. Since 2010, Google has announced that it will start research and development, and then BMW, Dongfeng, etc. have also begun to study. In the past four years, Google has conducted a number of self-driving cars on the road test. On December 2, 2017, Alphabus officially conducted trial operation in Futian, Shenzhen. However, Google’s testing still has some problems, and its security cannot be guaranteed. In addition to Google's self-driving cars, there are some problems with other cars. On March 18, 2018, there was even a casualty accident in Arizona, USA. But the researchers say that existing autonomous vehicles need hundreds of millions of kilometers to fully ensure their safety, which is almost impossible to complete. It may need years of multi-faceted research, the autonomous vehicles can be put into use. Once this technology is developed, it is obviously better to drive a car than humans, because humans cannot see 720 degrees at the same time. Even humans can see, sometimes they cannot be cool to take measures when face an emergency situation. And sometimes the driver does not know enough about the size of the car, which will cause some small rubbing, although the impact will not be great, it is also not what we want to happen. In addition to daily driving, it is also very helpful for long-distance travel. Because the driver can drive fatigue if he drives long distances, but the machine will not feel tired, so it can continue driving for a long distance. Of course, this requires the support of large-capacity batteries and fuel tanks, unless the automatic driving system can also detect the fuel tank remaining amount and driving automatically to the gas station.</p>
 
<p>Autonomous vehicles can be seen as a branch of the robot, which also involves artificial intelligence and mechatronics. Self-driving cars will be paired with radar sensors, video cameras and laser rangefinders to help autopilot. These things can help the car simulate the 3D picture of the surrounding environment, so that it can master the surrounding obstacles, including the specific location of pedestrians, other vehicles and other obstacles. Of course, GPS systems are also essential because they help cars master maps and road conditions to plan the right route. Its master computer will collect this data and perform calculations to control the car's driving. But in some complicated environments, the computer does not seem to be well qualified for its work.</p>

<p>Once the autopilot technology is mature, it can bring great benefits to human beings. Humans will almost no need to drive the car by themselves, they even do not need to learn to drive, or the requirements for obtaining a driver's license can be greatly reduced. Those who can't drive now can also drive by themselves and go out for a self-driving tour. This allows people to make better use of the time on the road, and also greatly saves time spent on the road. And once this technology is perfected, the probability of a car accident will be greatly reduced. This reduces some of the unexpected risk values of people. Those hospitals will not have to work hard to help the victims of the car accident, and the police will not have to worry about the car accident. Of course, there is never an absolute good thing in the world. If everyone relies on an automated driving system, those drivers, from taxi drivers to private drivers, will face unemployment and those driving schools will face bankruptcy. In addition, even those traffic broadcasts or traffic news sections will have almost no content to broadcast. And it's hard to say the future will not be racing because people may not understand the kind of excitement and a sense of control. In addition, the sales volume of cars will increase significantly, which makes the already tight parking resources become more tense, and the old vintage cars may face scrapping, which is a huge waste of resources. Perhaps the skills that humans will master will become less and less, because there are many things that can be replaced by machines and technology. This may be understood as a new kind of the death of civilization.</p>

<p>This has not had a big impact on myself, because almost everyone in my family drives a car and I have a driver's license myself. But I am still very willing to liberate myself and let the machine and computer replace me to drive, because I am not so confident in my own driving skills. And when driving, you need to pay attention to the surrounding environment and control your speed, which will make people fatigue soon. If not necessary, maybe no one really likes to drive (except racing enthusiasts). In addition, this also gives me the opportunity to travel by car to hundreds of kilometers or even thousands of kilometers away. I don't like to travel with the tour group because the trip is too fixed and the time is too tight. Renting a car means a relatively expensive fee. But when you are traveling in the field, having a car for your own use will really make the journey very comfortable and convenient. Also, if I need to go to have a meal where traffic is not very convenient, and I might drink, it is not convenient to drive. At this time, the automatic driving system will be very helpful to me. All in all, the impact of autonomous driving technology is far more beneficial than harm.</p>

		<h3>Machine learning</h3>
<p>Machine learning is a field of computer science  that uses statistical techniques to give computer systems the ability to "learn" (e.g., progressively improve performance on a specific task) with data, without being explicitly programmed. </p>
<p>The name machine learning was coined in 1959 by Arthur Samuel. Evolved from the study of pattern recognition  and computational learning method  in artificial intelligence  machine learning explores the study and construction of algorithms  that can learn from and make predictions on data – such algorithms overcome following strictly static program instructions  by making data-driven predictions or decisions, through building a model from sample inputs. Machine learning is employed in a range of computing tasks where designing and programming explicit algorithms with good performance is difficult or infeasible; example applications include email filters , detection of network intruders, and computer version . </p>
<p>Machine learning is closely related to (and often overlaps with) computational statics, which also focuses on prediction-making through the use of computers. It has strong ties to mathematical optimisation, which delivers methods, theory and application domains to the field. Machine learning is sometimes conflated with data mining  .where the latter subfield focuses more on exploration data analysis  and is known as unsupervised learning . </p>
<p>Within the field of data analytics , machine learning is a method used to devise complex models and algorithms that lend themselves to prediction; in commercial use, this is known as perspective analytics. These analytical models allow researchers, data scientists , engineers, and analysts to "produce reliable, repeatable decisions and results" and uncover "hidden insights" through learning from historical relationships and trends in the data. </p>
<p>Machine learning and data mining often employ the same methods and overlap significantly, but while machine learning focuses on prediction, based on known properties learned from the training data, data mining  focuses on the discovery  of (previously) unknown properties in the data (this is the analysis step of known discovery  in databases). Data mining uses many machine learning methods, but with different goals; on the other hand, machine learning also employs data mining methods as "unsupervised learning" or as a pre-processing step to improve learner accuracy. Much of the confusion between these two research communities (which do often have separate conferences and separate journals, ECML PKDD being a major exception) comes from the basic assumptions they work with: in machine learning, performance is usually evaluated with respect to the ability to reproduce known knowledge, while in knowledge discovery and data mining (KDD) the key task is the discovery of previously unknown knowledge. Evaluated with respect to known knowledge, an uninformed (unsupervised) method will easily be outperformed by other supervised methods, while in a typical KDD task, supervised methods cannot be used due to the unavailability of training data. </p>
<p>Impacts
<p>One of the biggest use cases currently seems to be in getting basic measurements in countries where there are lots of gaps in the basic statistics. Joshua Bluestocking referred to this as “Band-Aid” statistics. A lot of this work is using either satellite data or cell phone record data to try to predict poverty at a granular level for entire countries or continents (e.g. Oliver’s talk, Josh’s work in Rwanda, Marshall Burke’s work in Africa). </p>
<p>At the moment such data seems useful for descriptive work, but it is unclear whether accuracy is enough to measure changes well over time – so if you are trying to evaluate the impact of regional or macro policies, there may not be enough signal to be able to detect the impact of interventions, especially over short time horizons. But satellite data are now getting much more accurate, with daily data at relatively high resolution. </p>
 
<p>A second measurement use comes at a more micro level, enabling measurement of outcomes we might otherwise struggle to measure. One example comes from work by Ramya Parthasarathy. They use textual analysis of transcripts of India’s village assemblies to identify what topics are discussed, and how the flow of conversation varies with gender and status of the speaker. The vast volume of data would make this very hard to do systematically using traditional measurement methods. They can use this to find, for example, that female citizens are less likely to speak, less likely to drive the topic of conversation, and get fewer responses from state officials – but that when the village has been randomly chosen to have a female president, women citizens are more likely to receive a response than with a male president. </p>
<p>1) Telemarketers
 <p> You probably already receive robot-calls on behalf of various products and            services, and career growth in the telemarketing space is expected to decline by 3% by the year 2024. This is largely in part because of the requirements to be successful: Unlike other sales roles, telemarketers don't require a high level of social, or emotional, intelligence to be successful. Think about it -- are you likely to purchase from a telemarketer? Conversion rates for direct telephone sales are typically less than 10%, making this role a ripe opportunity to be automated. </p>
<p>2) Bookkeeping clerks</p>
 <p>Jobs in this role are expected to decline 8% by 2024, and it's no surprise why -- most bookkeeping is becoming automated, if it hasn't been already. QuickBooks, Fresh Books, and Microsoft Office already offer software that does the bookkeeping for you that's much more affordable than a person's salary, so it's no surprise this job has such a high probability. </p>
<p>Affects</p>
 
<p>1- Retail</p>
 
<p>The future of AI in retail is all about making your customer’s personalized offers, predicting future trends in order to optimize your stock and improve logistics. But, you can take benefit from it in plenty of ways: </p>
·<p> The vendor can organize catboats with BI technology and can hear out the complaints of unsatisfied customers. Today in America retailers are saving $23 billion by using Chabot’s. </p>
<p>· Online shopping has opened up doors for dangerous frauds, but with AI digital frauds can be minimized. </p>
<p>· AI cares about your time and only shows you ads and videos related to your taste only. Such as Facebook always shows posts related to our past searches. </p>
<p>2- Finance</p>
 <p>Well, apart from providing Chabot’s for financial advice and tool for making annual budgets, AI offers a lot in the financial sector. </p>
·<p> Today there are financial apps available that monitor your spending activities closely and advice you a wise way to spend your money. </p>
<p>· AI has taken over the stock trading totally and today everyone invests in stocks via computers. According to facts, computers are better investors with yearly profits of 8.44% vs 4.27% for average hedge funds. </p>
<p>3- Media</p>
<p>Media has gone through drastic change because of AI. Journalism and mass media gets the bigger blow. Whereas, advertisements industry is totally at the mercy of machine learning nowadays. </p>
 
<p> If automation technologies like robots and artificial intelligence make jobs less secure in the future, there needs to be a way to deliver benefits outside of employment.  “Flexuosity,” or flexible security, is one idea for providing healthcare, education, and housing assistance whether or not someone is formally employed.  Expanding the Earned Income Tax Credit, providing a guaranteed basic income, and encouraging corporate profit-sharing are some ideas that need to be considered in the case of persistent unemployment. These facilities are used in house</p> 

		<h3>Robot</h3>
		<p>A robot is a device that can perform a series of complex actions autonomously. It can be guided by an external control device or controlled by a built-in controller. The word comes from the Czech word : robota and refers to compulsory labor. The word was first used to refer to a fictional object similar to humans in a drama R.U.R in 1920. The author of the play was the Czech writer Karel Čapek but the creator of this word was his brother Josef Čapek. As early as centuries ago, people wanted to have something to replace human beings to do what they didn't want to do, those too dangerous or too boring, this is why robots are designed. With the rapid development of technology, robots seem to be getting closer and closer to us, the topic of robots has become more and more popular, and there are more and more games and movies about robots, such as Detroit: become human, which was so famous for a while ago. The androids inside are fully functional, will not be affected by emotions, and will always be perfect.</p>
<p>Making a robot is not a simple project, it is a combination of contemporary technology. To get the robot to work smoothly, you need three devices, drive, detection and control. The robot's drive is mainly electric drive, but also a small amount of hydraulic and pneumatic drive. The signal from the control system allows the drive system to move the robot through the power components. The detection device can monitor the movement and working condition of the robot through the sensor and feed back to the control system in real time. There are two types of sensors. The internal sensors mainly detect the movement of the robot itself, while the external sensors mainly detect the surrounding environment, so that the robot will take corresponding actions to adapt to the environment. The control system is the core of the robot. In most cases, all the actions and commands of the robot will be controlled by a microcomputer. Sometimes, the communication, actions, etc. of the robot are controlled by different microcomputers. In addition to these, in order to make the robot close enough to humans, it also needs big data support to get enough ‘experience’ to deal with various situations. It may also need a computer to synthesize a human-like voice and a set of movements close to humans.</p>
<p>In fact, today's robots can do a lot of things. They are widely used in workshops (pipeline), self-service machines and electronic butlers. But human instinct make them resent the objects that are too similar to themselves, and for some moral reasons, they have not been officially used. In essence, because they are machines, they don't need a lot of energy, and they use tiny computers to do a lot of computing. They are much more efficient than humans. Nowadays, people have created robots that can communicate with humans and make various expressions, but they are not perfect in physical movements. Maybe in the next three to five years, this problem can be solved. Once this problem is solved, the scope of application of future robots will become wider and wider. Except for creative careers, such as writing novels, writing songs, and drawing, which is still difficult for them, you can hardly think of what they can't do. Maybe you can see robotics in many positions in the future.</p>
<p>Once the robot is put into use, it will bring irreversible changes to humans. It can replace most of the work of human beings, can be a waiter, can help organize the shelves, can drive for humans and so on. If it becomes a home robot, it can clean the room for humans, cook, and even chat with humans. This society will reduce a lot of disputes caused by emotions, and perhaps the quality of life in the whole society will improve a lot. Moreover, if social service jobs can be replaced by robots, perhaps people have time to do some thinking work. Maybe more people can do creative work or do some small inventions and do some work that they like. Moreover, once people adapt to the help of robots, people will never be able to do without them, just as people can't live without the Internet.</p>
<p>Of course, the problems brought by robots cannot be ignored. The large number of robots put into use also means that the unemployment rate has risen sharply. The bosses of many industries will lay off a large number of employees. Those who have been in the service industry will not get paid or even become jealous. Once the unemployment problem is too serious, it is hard to say whether people will go to the procession or revolution. Once a fight occurs, the consequences will be unimaginable. And there are always species problems in robots and humans, which may create a new type of racial discrimination. In addition to these, artificial high intelligence, which may exceed human intelligence, also means uncontrollable, which is also a potential hidden danger. People should consider these issues before the robot is actually put into use.</p>	
<p>If I have a home robot, this makes me have to think of Jarvis in Iron Man. It can be said to be an extremely intimate smart butler and super hacker. I really want to have a robot, Because my future job and will likely be IT related, which is a strong a creative career, so I was not very worried about the robot will make unemployment. If the robot replaces a lot of human work, the daily work efficiency will be greatly improved, which may mean that I can spend less time to reach the destination. If you go to the restaurant, you can wait for less time to serve and so on. This definitely improved my life. Home robots will also have a lot of positive effects on me. Because of the professionalism of the robot, it can know a lot of things that I don't know, so it can help me in many ways. Besides, he can also do a lot of daily work for me, such as housework, which means I can have more time for myself, and it will be a good helper for me. There is another important thing. When there is another ‘people’ I am familiar with at home, I will feel less lonely. Even if it doesn't necessarily talk to me or do something, I still feel that I am not alone. Although I already have a cat, it is much more fun to raise a person than to raise a cat.</p>

	       <h2>Project ideas</h2>
<p>Well there are several projects available but I am most passionate about IOT(internet of things) car parking which is more helpful for the people to park there cars on the side parking of the roads or access the smart city application from anywhere of the world to find the space in the parking and get information about spotting parking. It also provide efficient car parking management through the remote. While connecting with remote as well as access with smart city application to find the space and suitable parking near by for our profit these things are interested in this project because in modern world such types of projects are more profitable for betterment even these types systems are also time saving with the help of which every one save time and get a better facility in every smart city. </p>
<p>In this project there are different types of IT (Information technology) innovation are used such as people can use his mobile device and computer to access the smart city application from every where in the world to find parking spot in the city and get to confirm the which parking spot is still available. Eventually , the use of different shorts of applications as well as access with remotes are helpful me in my ideal job to make it more better with better skills. Moreover, smart dustbin with IOT notification, 3D Holographic Display system with Gesture controller and many more projects are helpful for ideal job.</p>
<p>the project is IOT car parking system which is totally access by smart city application on our mobile or remote control technology. In this modern congested cities car parking is the major hinders for every nation because of there are many vehicles on the road and not enough parking space. This led to the need of efficient parking management systems. Thus we reflect the use of IOT based parking management system that allows for efficient parking space utilisation using IOT Technology . In this project we shows that the IR sensors are use for sensing parking slot occupancy alone with dc motors to simulate as gate opener motors . </p> 
<p>moving towards smart city application, smart parking is a good for everyone one in this daily living environment to provide different services the Internet Of Things ( IOT ) are very efficient and effective. Every citizen may use   mobile device , a computer having Internet to access the smart city application from anywhere in the world to find a free parking spot in the city and get to know the which parking spot is current available.  It provide effective and efficient car parking management through remote parking spot localization and fast car retrieval.</p>
<p>The smart city application is the software which help every people to find the parking spot and suitable car parking near by them with the help of IOT( internet of things ) . In our proposed system we have used IR Sensors , Temp sensor , and LDR sensor as end node. In this car parking system we deal with many layers of the network to establish a connection between hardware and software . Protocols used in each layer have a specific task physical layer deals with the electrical and mechanical  support to the system.</p>
<p>after the successful projects there are some outcomes such as congested parking areas and unable to understand easily these systems for unknown persons because the smart parking system is based on IOT concept has been implemented using various sensor circuitry and cloud such as IR sensor and many others. With this system the problem of congested parking system will be solved easily and organise awareness programs toward such system to get well knowledgeable person . It is an efficient car parking system which prevails traffic congestion. This work is further extended as a smart car parking system with automatic billing system also fully automated system using multilayer Parking method and pay money with cards and cash as well. Safety measures such as vehicles no .</p>

	       <h2>Group Reflection</h2>
		<h3>Andrew Group Reflection: </h3>
<p>Although we did begin off with a very rough start, with everyone all over the place, we ended up narrowing down and allocating our tasks effectively across the members in the group, a thing that we could have improved on would be to be able to communicate properly as some of us did not have social media so our only form of communication was WhatsApp but even then the responses were rather delayed hence inability to communicate effectively. What surprised me was the different sets of interests and what we each wanted to do in the future was completely different to one another, hence each person had a job that was distinctive to the person, and that made it an interesting fact ķto learn about per person. Overall the group's contributions ended up being a success in the end, and as a result we had finished the assignment on time. </p>
<h3>NAVJOT Singh Group Reflection:</h3> <p>well there are our three members group we are done all work well . Initial we are discuss about work and divided it into three part so that everyone can do there part with their energy as well as skills related to our assignment. Moreover, we discussed about work and helping each others to complete the assignment. Even, we are also improved our way to communicate with each other with the help of social media ( WhatsApp and Facebook), as some of our group members are not used such app before when we are started our assignment work then we will find the easier way to contact with each other rather then y calling again and again. There is most surprising thing is that we never know about them or each other after starting our work we got friend and well informed about every one. Therefore, i have learned several things while working in group such as team working skills and got experience to cooperate with everyone to complete our task as soon as.Lastly, I need to explain that we all group members are well knowledgeable about github . We all complete our work and after that uploaded on github to demonstrate it easily and get success  in our work and in better result .</p>
<h3>Krista reflection:</h3><p>Due to the late formation of our team, time is very urgent. But we quickly divided the work and started the assignment. The good thing is we quickly divided the work after we met and started the assignment. Because everyone in the team is good at and like to do different things, we try to get everyone to do what they are good at, so that we can finish our assignment faster. I also learned how to conduct team communication discussions and division of labor. In general, although we encountered some difficulties and setbacks, we still completed our assignment very well, and I am satisfied with this team cooperation.</p>
