	    <h3>Personal information</h3>
	    <h4>Andrew</h4>
	    <p>Hi my name is Andrew Chen, my student number is S3599919 and I am a manager at  Simple Tech. I was born and raised in Australia, specifically in Carlton. My nationality is Chinese and I can speak both Cantonese and Mandarin. I really love learning about computers and specifically on how to assemble and troubleshoot, my hobbies include gaming on the PC and playing basketball with my friends. My interests in I.T include learning how to build computers and learning more in depth about troubleshooting, I do not have much I.T experience outside of home, as I am more of a self-taught learner, hence majority of the things I learn are from the Internet or from PC Magazines. 

</p>
	    <h4>Navjot</h4>
	    <p>Hi my name is Navjot Singh, my student number is S3730255 and I am also a manager at Simple Tech. I was born in and raised in India and my nationality is Indian, but i can also speak Punjabi, Hindi and English. My interests in I.T are related to the designing and developing of effective software, hence I hope to become a software engineer or a website developer in the near future. </p>
	      <h4>Krista</h4>
	    <p>Hi my name is Bingxin Ni, but people call me Krista, my student number is S3632682. Like Andrew and Navjot, I am also a manager at Simple Tech. I was born and raised in Nanjing, Jiangsu Province, China. I speak Mandarin majority of the times but I can also speak English.  My interests include playing games because I have been playing it ever since I was very young, it allows me to have a better understanding of how games work and hopefully with the technology that I learn I am able to create my own game in the future.I have learned some about 3D modeling and I have learned some simple I.T. knowledge, but almost no  experience.</p>
	<h3>Team Profile</h3>
	     <h4>Andrew</h4>
	    <p>Firstly, starting off with the Myer-Briggs Test, the results that were acquired from that test stated that I had what they call a "Consul" Personality which meant that I was known for my reliability and kindness, and are able to create and maintain a secure and stable environment for myself and my loved ones. Secondly, the learning style test has unrevealed that I am a Visual Learner. The IPIP Big Five Factor results have shown that I was an Extrovert, which meant that I was outgoing and social. I was close to 100% Emotional Stability meaning that I am functioning almost perfectly without any interruptions to my work ability due to my mental health state. I am agreeable towards many things as I am friendly and very optimistic, I am also conscientious with whatever I do and diligent, and last but not least I am open to new experiences.

ability to ask questions<br>
	    I don't think that some software design and web design rankings are low, and testers and graphic designers are ranked very high. I think software designers should be a hot job. Also, many people think that quality and task completion time are not that important. I think that overtime to complete the task is a very bad thing, and those products should have high quality.
