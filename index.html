	    I don't think that some software design and web design rankings are low, and testers and graphic designers are ranked very high. I think software designers should be a hot job. Also, many people think that quality and task completion time are not that important. I think that overtime to complete the task is a very bad thing, and those products should have high quality.

	       <h2>IT Work</h2>
			<p><h4>1. Please tell us about your IT work. What exactly do you do?</h4>
I am a Technical Support Officer – I administer the business and systems to ensure that employees are able to use the technological tools required to perform their daily work tasks.
<h4>2. Please tell us about the industry you work in.</h4>
I work in a globally recognized real estate firm.
<h4>3. What other kinds of work do you have to do?</h4>
I mainly deal with troubleshooting and resolving issues that users are experiencing. We also undergo projects that involve rolling out new technologies to enhance work productivity and improve business processes.

<h4>4. Who are all the different people you interact with in your work? Please tell us about them.</h4>
We deal with internal users only which are the people within our organization. Mainly filled with agents who can be demanding from time to time when they are under pressure from communicating with external clients, we also assist team assistants who are the backbone in supporting their team members.
<h4>5. Please tell us about your interactions with other IT professionals.</h4>
We work closely together as a team to share knowledge and discuss/escalate issues across the Australia and New Zealand region, via different platforms such as instant messaging, emails, audio and video calls.
<h4>6. What about your interactions with clients or investors?</h4>
We don’t really interact with other clients, apart from a team which we escalate higher issues to.
<h4>7. What aspects of your work do you spend most time on? Please tell us about these.</h4>
Mainly troubleshooting, each and every day is always a different and odd issue. 
<h4>8. Which aspects of your work do you find most challenging?</h4>
The most challenging thing about this work is embracing the different issues that spontaneously occur, as it requires quick analysis and thinking of the situation. Sometimes you may not come across issues before so you have to try the best that you can to troubleshoot, isolate the possible factors that could contribute to the problem and find the root cause of it.
<h4>9. Finally, can you share an example of the work you do that best captures the essence of the IT industry?</h4>
Personally I feel that what best captures the essence of IT is delivering a seamless experience. This means that fixing/resolving/setting ups things while the user is not around, or before they even get into the office so that they get to their desk as if everything is functioning perfectly fine, as if there was no issue. We strongly try to be proactive and prevent issues from happening, as opposed to being reactive to when an issue arises.

		<h3>Cyber security</h3>
		<p>Cybersecurity is the protection of internet-connected systems, including hardware, software and data, from cyberattacks. In a computing context, security comprises cybersecurity and physical security -- both are used by enterprises to protect against unauthorized access to data centres and other computerized systems. Information security, which is designed to maintain the confidentiality, integrity and availability of data centres and computerised system. Information security ,which is designed to maintain the confidentiality ,integrity and availability of data , is a sunset of cyber security.
Ensuring cybersecurity requires the coordination of efforts throughout an information system, which includes:
· Application security
· Information security
· Network security
One of the most problematic elements of cybersecurity is the constantly evolving nature of security risks. The traditional approach has been to focus resources on crucial system components and protect against the biggest known threats, which meant leaving components undefended and not protecting systems against less dangerous risks.
 As the cyber threat landscape continues to grow and emerging threats, such as the internet of things, require hardware and software skills, it is estimated that there are 1 million unfilled cybersecurity jobs worldwide. IT professionals and other computer specialists are needed in security jobs, such as:
· chief information security officer(CISO): this individual implements the security program across the organization and oversees the IT security department's operations;
· security engineer: this individual protects company assets from threats with a focus on quality control within the IT infrastructure;
· security architect: this individual is responsible for planning, analysing, designing, testing, maintaining and supporting an enterprise's critical infrastructure; and
· security analyst: this individual has several responsibilities that include planning security measures and controls, protecting digital files, and conducting both internal and external security audits.
The cyber threat landscape is constantly evolving, with different strains of malware attacking network systems every day. Organisations are losing the cyber war and, as a result, cybersecurity needs to evolve to combat the growing problem created by cyber attacks. This may take the form of security systems integrated with AI or simply stricter regulations so organisations will take the threat more seriously. Over the next five years, cyber security will evolve. But in what ways? Will the balance of the cyber war change, or will hackers still reign supreme? Information Age asked ten cyber security experts for their views on how the cyber security landscape will evolve in the next five years.
1 Automation
Security vendor check points regional director for Northern Europe, Nick Lowe, suggests that the standard cyber security practice will see automated responses to cyber attacks.
Cyber security defences will use more intelligence, big data analysis and machine learning to automatically identify threats and work proactively to expose and correlate the full operation of new cyber attack campaigns, he says. For example, a new attack might start with a malicious link being sent in an email to an Office 365 cloud.
The security solution will identify this, block the attack and upload the ‘indicators of compromise’ of the attack – that is, how it works – to a cloud-based threat intelligence service, which correlates it with other attack types.
‘So new attacks using that malicious link or website – for example, sending it by WhatsApp or SMS – get blocked automatically, before the attack can take hold. These attacks might otherwise seem unrelated, but in fact they could belong to a single attack campaign that is targeting an organisation using multiple vectors.
2  Block chain
Ian Smith, CEO and founder of Gospel Technology, believes that blockchain will be essential in protecting data from malicious attacks.
One way to tackle this issue of cyber security is with the use of a distributed ledger system, better known as blockchain, which guarantees the integrity and identity of the content appended through decentralised validation.
‘Once recorded, this data cannot be changed, ensuring provenance and history for the key trust indicators of the digital assets,’ says Smith. ‘For data regulation, these are bound to a cryptographic hash and can then absolutely guarantee the integrity of the data.
Impact of cyber attack on your business
A successful cyber attack can cause major damage to your business. It can affect your bottom line, as well as your business' standing and consumer trust. The impact of a security breach can be broadly divided into three categories: financial, reputational and legal.
Economic cost of cyber attack
Cyber attacks often result in substantial financial loss arising from:
· theft of corporate information
· theft of financial information (eg bank details or payment card details)
· theft of money


Reputational damage
Trust is an essential element of customer relationship. Cyber attacks can damage your business' reputation and erode the trust your customers have for you. This, in turn, could potentially lead to:
· loss of customers
· loss of sales
 
Legal consequences of cyber breach
Data protection and privacy laws require you manage the security of all personal data you hold - whether on your staff or your customers. If this data is accidentally or deliberately compromised, and you have failed to deploy appropriate security measures, you may face fines and regulatory sanctions
 
The human touch
Other professions which are less vulnerable to automation are those that require a human touch — from personal fitness trainers to beauticians and healthcare workers.
Nursing has existed as a profession for more than 150 years but is in no danger of being taken over by machines, according to Professor Phillip Della, head of the School of Nursing, Midwifery and Para medicine at Curtin University.
"You can automate tasks, you can have robots and you can use computers for diagnostic testing, but the caring factor, the human touch, having a nurse involved in that patient journey can't be replaced by a robot," Professor Della said.
Security architect
The senior-level security architect position involves designing, building, and overseeing the implementation of network and computer security for a company. Security architects must plan, research, and design strong security architectures for all IT projects, perform security assessments, respond to incidents, develop requirements for LANs, WANs, VPNs, routers, firewalls, and other network devices, as well as design PKIs, among other tasks.
Affects
HACKED ACCOUNTS
One common way for identity thieves to gain control of consumers’ personal information is through digital crimes known as “phishing.” In this practice, fraudsters create an email that looks like it was issued from a legitimate company. They will ask for a recipient’s personal information – like an account number or a password – and then use that information to commit financial crimes, such as opening fraudulent charge cards in a consumer’s name and running up big bills on them.
UNSECURED HOME WIRELESS NETWORKS
Many of us have converted to home wireless Internet networks to connect our TVs, smartphones, laptops, computers and tablets. And why not? It’s very convenient. But with these home networks come risks. Without certain protections, cyber criminals in the area may be able to access the Internet through your network and possibly gain access to your computer and other devices.
SPAM
You already know that “spam” is the email equivalent of junk mail. But it can do more than clutter up your inbox. Some of these email missives can contain a link or an attachment prompting you to download a computer virus. They can also be used to defraud those close to you. For instance, someone who has hacked into your email account can send a message asking every one of your contacts to wire money because you are in distress – and possibly rope in a few people who aren’t familiar with this common fraud
The number of connected devices has exponentially grown in the last year and there is a constant need to be connected. In fact, people are willing to engage in risky online behaviour in order to simply access Wi-Fi.
People are also known to share their passwords with friends, access financial information via unsecured Wi-Fi connections and click on suspicious links thereby increasing the vulnerability of their connected devices. Eighty percent of the consumers who took a compromising action in response to a potential phishing incident experienced negative consequences, including identify theft, money stolen from bank accounts, credit cards opened in their name and unauthorized apps installed on their device.
