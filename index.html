	    <h3>Andrew</h3>
	    <p>Hi my name is Andrew Chen, my student number is S3599919 and I am a manager at  Simple Tech. I was born and raised in Australia, specifically in Carlton. My nationality is Chinese and I can speak both Cantonese and Mandarin. I really love learning about computers and specifically on how to assemble and troubleshoot, my hobbies include gaming on the PC and playing basketball with my friends. My interests in I.T include learning how to build computers and learning more in depth about troubleshooting, I do not have much I.T experience outside of home, as I am more of a self-taught learner, hence majority of the things I learn are from the Internet or from PC Magazines.
